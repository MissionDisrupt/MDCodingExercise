# Mission Disrupt Coding Exercise

------

Thank you for taking part in the Mission Disrupt coding exercise!


**Objective**

Our objective with this challenge is to test your ability to recreate a design put before you. The main thing we are looking for with this exercise is how accurate you can translate from image to code, and how functional the site is on both desktop and mobile.


**Challenge**

You are to create a responsive website that looks as close as possible to the image you are given. This page should be fully responsive, which means that the final website should look like the image when viewing the final site on a desktop, and should look like a mobile version of that site when viewed on a phone or tablet. You will be given the desktop version of the site only and it will be up to you to make the site look good on mobile as well. Any assets you see can be replaced with placeholder images(of your choosing), and any icons can be Font Awesome icons. If you have extra time left over, feel free to add animations (hover effects, scroll effects, etc.) as you see fit. Animations are not required for this exercise. You will have **two hours** to complete this exercise. If you have any questions or comments while building the page, write them down in a document and put that file in your project folder. When the time is up, please put all the files into a compressed ZIP archive and send us that ZIP file.

**Developing**

The starter project uses the Brunch build tool. To use brunch you must first install the local dependencies of this project by running `npm install` in the root of this directory. You also need the Brunch command line tool. You can get that by running `npm install -g brunch`. Your HTML file lives at `app/assets/index.html`. Your SASS files live in `app/styles.scss`. You can add Javascript to `app/initialize.js`. To build the project, run `brunch build` in the root of the project. To have your code recompile as you are developing, just run `brunch watch` in the root of the project. This project ships with Font Awesome and Bootstrap 4. If you don't want to use Bootstrap that is fine. Feel free to remove the `link` and `script` tags in the `index.html` file.

**Email Us to recieve the design files to begin.**

**Design Notes**

- Hover Effects: `Badge.png` is the image that should show up when a user hovers one of the five categories in the design.
- Feel free to use dummy text.
